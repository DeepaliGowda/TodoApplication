Todo Application Using React JS
This To-Do application is a simple and efficient tool for managing daily tasks, built using React.js. 
It allows users to easily add tasks they need to complete, with each task displayed in a clear, organized list. 
When a task is done, users can click on it to strike it out, visually indicating its completion. Completed tasks automatically move to the bottom of the list, keeping the most urgent tasks at the top. 
Additionally, the app provides the option to delete tasks when they are no longer needed. 
A counter at the bottom of the app displays the total number of tasks and the number of tasks completed, helping users keep track of their progress throughout the day.
